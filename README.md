# Python_Mini_Project
The aim of the project is to extract the data present in different spreadsheets in one excel file as required by the user. The excel sheet consists of 5 spreadsheets with the following data:

 

1.year
2.Population of different country yearwise

 

The user defines the data that needs to be searched on the basis of year. The python program then reads the data corresponding to the particular data from different spreadsheets of excel. It then creates a mastersheet and adds the data from all the sheets to it. At the end it will generate another mastersheet containing total no of rows and columns.

    
## Problem Statement:-
In this microsoft excel sheet is often called as worksheet. 
A sheet is a single page that contains its own collection of cells help us to organize data.
Excel spreadsheets do well for small datasets and for a reduced pool of data operations.
when the projects become bigger and require more sophisticated data operations, than it becomes very hard to work on that data manually. 
several methods have been proposed in order to combat this.
one is to handel datasheet through python programming.
Our problem is We have to create 1 excel file and under that excel file there should be 5 sheets, each sheet should contain 40 rows and 10 columns.
